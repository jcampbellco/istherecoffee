# Is There Coffee?

Meet, coffeebot:

Coffeebot lives above the office coffee pot, and enables increased developer synergy and allows for fluid development of caffeine consumption.

Simply put, it's a Slack connected bot written in Python to take pictures of the office coffee pot.

Development is sporadic, fun, and not serious in the slightest.

### ToDo

* Add rate limiting
* Keep track of users that have requested coffee
* Add voting or round-robin feature to decide who should make coffee
* Simple thermal camera to tell if coffee is hot
* Dynamic responses (ie: stop using a big if...then statement)
* Add process monitoring so it can be logged and killed if needed
