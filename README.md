# Is There Coffee?

### ToDo

* Add rate limiting
* Keep track of users that have requested coffee
* Add voting or round-robin feature to decide who should make coffee
* Simple thermal camera to tell if coffee is hot
* Dynamic responses (ie: stop using a big if...then statement)
* Add process monitoring so it can be logged and killed if needed
